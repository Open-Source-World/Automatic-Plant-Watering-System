# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System<br>
As the name suggest it automatically transfers water from the water source to the plants!
<br> Here is the <b>detail:</b><br>
The main aim of this project is to build a system that will automate watering functionality through a smartphone that will enhance the functionality of humans to reach and water the crops or plants present on large surface areas such as fields or large botanical gardens etc.<br>
Hence, we decided to do a thorough research on this topic and develop an AUTOMATIC WATERING SYSTEM which will be controlled by Bluetooth system from android smartphone.<br>
It will contain features like: -<br>
1.	Can be controlled by any android smartphone using Bluetooth<br>
2.	Can be easily assembled on site<br>
3.	Lowest cost possible for making<br>
4.	Accurate in every move possible<br>
5.	Can reach large areas<br>
6.	Can be used in any field or garden<br>
7.	Can be used in remote areas where there is no electricity<br>
This System will help you to irrigate your backyard Garden or your Indoor Garden automatically and you need not worry about watering your favorite plants in your busy schedule.<br>
